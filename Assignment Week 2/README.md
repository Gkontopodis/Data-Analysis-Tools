# Hypothesis Testing and Chi Square Test of Independence

## Preview
This assignment aims to directly test my hypothesis by evaluating, based on a sample of 2412 U.S. cannabis users aged between 18 and 30 years old **(subsetc2)**, my research question with the goal of generalizing the results to the larger population of NESARC survey, from where the sample has been drawn. Therefore, I statistically assessed the evidence, provided by NESARC codebook, in favor of or against the association between cannabis use and mental illnesses, such as major depression and general anxiety, in U.S. adults. As a result, in the first place I used crosstab function, in order to produce a contingency table of observed counts and percentages for each disorder separately. Next, I wanted to examine if the cannabis use status (1=Yes or 2=No) variable ‘S3BQ1A5’, which is a 2-level categorical explanatory variable, is correlated with depression **(‘MAJORDEP12’)** and anxiety **(‘GENAXDX12’)** disorders, which are both categorical response variables. Thus, I ran Chi-square Test of Independence (C->C) twice and calculated the χ-squared values and the associated p-values for each disorder, so that null and alternate hypothesis are specified. In addition, in order visualize the association between frequency of cannabis use and depression diagnosis, I used factorplot function to produce a bivariate graph. Furthermore, I used crosstab function once again and tested the association between the frequency of cannabis use **(‘S3BD5Q2E’)**, which is a 10-level categorical explanatory variable, and major depression diagnosis, which is a categorical response variable. In this case, for my third Chi-square Test of Independence (C->C), after measuring the χ-square value and the p-value, in order to determine which frequency groups are different from the others, I performed a post hoc test, using Bonferroni Adjustment approach, since my explanatory variable has more than 2 levels. In the case of ten groups, I actually need to conduct 45 pair wise comparisons, but in fact I examined indicatively two and compared their p-values with the Bonferroni adjusted p-value, which is calculated by dividing p=0.05 by 45. By this way it is possible to identify the situations where null hypothesis can be safely rejected without making an excessive type 1 error.  For the code and the output I used Spyder (IDE).

When examining the patterns of association between major depression (categorical response variable) and cannabis use status (categorical explanatory variable), a chi-square test of independence revealed that among young adults aged between 18 and 30 years old (subsetc1), those who were cannabis users, were more likely to have been diagnosed with major depression in the last 12 months (18%), compared to the non-users (8.4%), X2 =171.6, 1 df, p=3.16e-39 (p-value is written in scientific notation). As a result, since our p-value is extremely small, the data provides significant evidence against the null hypothesis. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis, which indicates that there is a positive correlation between cannabis use and depression diagnosis.

When testing the correlation between general anxiety (categorical response variable) and cannabis use status (categorical explanatory variable), a chi-square test of independence revealed that among young adults aged between 18 and 30 years old (subsetc1), those who were cannabis users, were more likely to have been diagnosed with general anxiety in the last 12 months (3.8%), compared to the non-users (1.6%), X2 =40.22, 1 df, p=2.26e-10 (p-value is written in scientific notation). As a result, since our p-value is again extremely small, the data provides significant evidence against the null hypothesis. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis, which indicates that there is a positive correlation between cannabis use and anxiety diagnosis.

A Chi Square test of independence revealed that among cannabis users aged between 18 and 30 years old (subsetc2), the frequency of cannabis use (explanatory variable collapsed into 10 ordered categories) and past year depression diagnosis (response binary categorical variable) were significantly associated, X2 =35.18, 10 df, p=0.00011.

In the bivariate graph (C->C) presented above, we can see the correlation between frequency of cannabis use (explanatory variable) and major depression diagnosis in the past year (response variable). Obviously, we have a left-skewed distribution, which indicates that the more an individual (18-30) smoked cannabis, the better were the chances to have experienced depression in the last 12 months.

The post hoc comparison (Bonferroni Adjustment) of rates of major depression by the pair of “Every day” and “2 times a year” frequency categories, revealed that the p-value is 0.00019 and the percentages of major depression diagnosis for each frequency group are 23.7% and 11.6% respectively. As a result, since the p-value is smaller than the Bonferroni adjusted p-value (adj p-value = 0.05 / 45 = 0.0011>0.00019), we can assume that these two rates are significantly different from one another. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate.

Similarly, the post hoc comparison (Bonferroni Adjustment) of rates of major depression by the pair of "Nearly every day” and “once a month” frequency categories, indicated that the p-value is 0.046 and the proportions of major depression diagnosis for each frequency group are 23.3% and 13.7% respectively. As a result, since the p-value is larger than the Bonferroni adjusted p-value (adj p-value = 0.05 / 45 = 0.0011<0.046), we can assume that these two rates are not significantly different from one another. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis.
