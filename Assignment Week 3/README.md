# Hypothesis Testing and Pearson Correlation

## Preview
This assignment aims to statistically assess the evidence, provided by NESARC codebook, in favor of or against the association between cannabis use and mental illnesses, such as major depression and general anxiety, in U.S. adults. More specifically, since my research question includes only categorical variables, I selected three new quantitative variables from the NESARC codebook. Therefore, I redefined my hypothesis and examined the correlation between the age when the individuals began using cannabis the most (quantitative explanatory, variable **“S3BD5Q2F”**) and the age when they experienced the first episode of major depression and general anxiety (quantitative response, variables **“S4AQ6A”** and **”S9Q6A”**). As a result, in the first place, in order to visualize the association between cannabis use and both depression and anxiety episodes, I used seaborn library to produce a scatterplot for each disorder separately and interpreted the overall patterns, by describing the direction, as well as the form and the strength of the relationships. In addition, I ran Pearson correlation test (Q->Q) twice (once for each disorder) and measured the strength of the relationships between each pair of quantitative variables, by numerically generating both the correlation coefficients r and the associated p-values. For the code and the output I used Spyder (IDE).

The three quantitative variables that I used for my Pearson correlation tests are:

## Output

The scatterplot presented above, illustrates the correlation between the age when individuals began using cannabis the most (quantitative explanatory variable) and the age when they experienced the first episode of depression (quantitative response variable). The direction of the relationship is positive (increasing), which means that an increase in the age of cannabis use is associated with an increase in the age of the first depression episode. In addition, since the points are scattered about a line, the relationship is linear. Regarding the strength of the relationship, from the pearson correlation test we can see that the correlation coefficient is equal to 0.23, which indicates a weak linear relationship between the two quantitative variables. The associated p-value is equal to 2.27e-09 (p-value is written in scientific notation) and the fact that its is very small means that the relationship is statistically significant. As a result, the association between the age when began using cannabis the most and the age of the first depression episode is moderately weak, but it is highly unlikely that a relationship of this magnitude would be due to chance alone. Finally, by squaring the r, we can find the fraction of the variability of one variable that can be predicted by the other, which is fairly low at 0.05.

For the association between the age when individuals began using cannabis the most (quantitative explanatory variable) and the age when they experienced the first episode of anxiety (quantitative response variable), the scatterplot psented above shows a positive linear relationship. Regarding the strength of the relationship, the pearson correlation test indicates that the correlation coefficient is equal to 0.14, which is interpreted to a fairly weak linear relationship between the two quantitative variables. The associated p-value is equal to 0.0001, which means that the relationship is statistically significant. Therefore, the association between the age when began using cannabis the most and the age of the first anxiety episode is weak, but it is highly unlikely that a relationship of this magnitude would be due to chance alone. Finally, by squaring the r, we can find the fraction of the variability of one variable that can be predicted by the other, which is very low at 0.01.
